- **Kenyir:** On-prem data lake for storing meter data.
- **meterAPI:** Middleware for data ingestion and AI predictions.
- **Puteri:** Analytics and dashboard for visualizing data.

## Features
- Real-time data ingestion from IFIX systems.
- Predictive maintenance using machine learning models.
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring and analytics.

## Quick Start
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the system: `docker-compose up`.
